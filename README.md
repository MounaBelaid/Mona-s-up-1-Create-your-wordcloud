# Mona-s-up-1-Create-your-wordcloud

This Shiny application is powered by R software.
You just need a text to copy and paste in the box then to click on the run button in order to create a wordcloud and obtain a table in a dynamic format that shows every word in the text and its frequency. Don't worry the text will be cleaned before displaying the wordcloud.
That means punctuations and stopwords would automatically be removed.
You can download the plot and save it as well.
